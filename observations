Observations:
look for the word by?
look for capturing non main verbs to check for causality
does passive voice discredit a verb or not? see 12 (14 is an example that this might not be the case)
How to detect non verb phrases which indicate causality? (see 27 and 39) maybe "causes of" (?)
Should we have something to check if it is between nominal pair
Try and get statistics on the word "from" - see 32
Check if the main verb is between the nominal pair else discredit it? 
	maybe take it a step further and look at all verbs in between the nominal pair (get statistics)

(a lot of product-producer seems like cause-effect)
1. NOT - has "as" but is not causal, as is not between nominal pairs
7. has "caused by" in between the nominal pair - main verb is "is" so wouldn't find it as causal verb - also has "results" afterwards
12 NOT the main verb is sunk which is considered a causal verb - is "has sunk" however, can passive voice discredit?
14. has "caused by" in between the nominal pair - also note it says "has been caused"
15. NOT - has "have moved" - moved would be considered causal
23. has "caused" in between nominal pair - caused is considered the main verb
27. "causes of", causes here is a noun instead of a verb, also is between nominal pair
30. WRONG - I think this is also a causal sentence (the timer eliminates wasted power consumption) ie causes the wasteful power consumption to be gone
32. currently have nothing that would detect it - has the word "from" in between nominal pair by itself
35. WRONG ? - think this could also be causal "in order to" also the word "reduce" is causal
39 "causes of" - the main verb is "is" which obviously is non causal - is between nominal pair
41 "that caused the" - is not the main verb - is between the nominal pair
45 "are caused by" - not sure if it is considered causal verb - in between nominal pair
48 "as" is not between the nominal pair and should not matter - "caused by" is in between the nominal pair
51 "from the" is between the nominal pair
53 currently cannot capture - "arose from" is in between the nominal pair
54 "from" is between the nominal pair
56. WRONG?
61. NOT "moving" is a causal verb and is in present perfect progressive (consider as case against using this as discreditor " the chemical leaks have been generating cases of cancer") (does the preposition afterwards discredit?)
66. WRONG? consider that the charge of the calvary caused the rout (don't think this can be handled at all seeing as completed isn't considered a causal verb) - are there any other words that should be looked for in definitions?
1612 WRONG is also causal in addition to the other
7317 WRONG? not sure why it is marked other

a less than 167 of 407 not captured are because of "from" being more than 3
	from is in prepositional phrase
	70 have from right after first noun
	need to discredit temporal froms
